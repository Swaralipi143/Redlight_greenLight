ðŸš¦ Red Light, Green Light - Built with Three.js! ðŸš¦

Excited to share my latest project â€“ a Red Light, Green Light game created using Three.js! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

This project allowed me to dive deep into 3D rendering, animations, and game logic, bringing an interactive experience to life in the browser. Some key features include:

ðŸ”¹ Real-time player movement detection
ðŸ”¹ Smooth transitions and animations
ðŸ”¹ Dynamic lighting and immersive 3D environment

Working on this project has been a fantastic journey, helping me improve my skills in JavaScript, 3D graphics, and performance optimization. ðŸš€
